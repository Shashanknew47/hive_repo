1. Download vechile sales data -> https://github.com/shashank-mishra219/Hive-Class/blob/main/sales_order_data.csv

2. Store raw data into hdfs location

3. Create a internal hive table "sales_order_csv" which will store csv data sales_order_csv .. make sure to skip header row while creating table

4. Load data from hdfs path into "sales_order_csv" 

5. Create an internal hive table which will store data in ORC format "sales_order_orc"

6. Load data from "sales_order_csv" into "sales_order_orc"


Perform below menioned queries on "sales_order_orc" table :

a. Calculate total sales per year
   
      SELECT year_id, cast(sum(sales) as int) as total_sales FROM sales_order_data_orc GROUP BY year_id;

year_id	total_sales
2004	     4724162
2005	     1791486
2003	     3516979

b. Find a product for which maximum orders were placed

      with total_orders as (SELECT productline, count(productline) as total_s FROM sales_order_data_orc GROUP BY productline)
    > SELECT productline FROM (SELECT productline,total_s FROM total_orders ORDER BY total_s DESC) as p limit 1;
     
       OK

       productline
       Classic Cars
      



c. Calculate the total sales for each quarter

      select cast(sum(sales) as int) as total_sales, qtr_id FROM sales_order_data_orc GROUP BY qtr_id order by qtr_id;

total_sales	qtr_id
2350817	1
2048120	2
1758910	3
3874780	4


d. In which quarter sales was minimum

    WITH quater_sales as (select cast(sum(sales) as int) as total_sales, qtr_id FROM sales_order_data_orc GROUP BY qtr_id order by qtr_id)
    > SELECT qtr_id FROM (SELECT qtr_id,total_sales FROM quater_sales  ORDER BY total_sales  limit 1) as minimum_quater_sales;
     
     qtr_id
      3


e. In which country sales was maximum and in which country sales was minimum
      
   

f. Calculate quarterly sales for each city
   


h. Find a month for each year in which maximum number of quantities were sold

     hive> with month_sales as (SELECT year_id, month_id, sum(quantityordered) as total_sales   FROM sales_order_data_orc GROUP BY year_id, month_id)
    > SELECT year_id, month_id, total_sales 
    > FROM (SELECT year_id, month_id, total_sales, 
    >  max(total_sales) over ( partition by year_id) as yearly_sales FROM month_sales) as sales
    >       WHERE total_sales = yearly_sales;

year_id	month_id	total_sales
2003	      11	        10179
2004	      11	        10678
2005	      5	        4357
